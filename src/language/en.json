    "about-info-1": "Hello, I'm Alvaro Flores, a graduate of the Universidad Mayor de San Andres. I consider myself a person passionate about programming and software development. With a focus on Software Architecture and DevOps, and experience in managing LAN - WAN networks. I have evolved from full-stack web development to more strategic and infrastructure-oriented roles, focused on improving the efficiency of development and deployment processes. My goal is to continue perfecting my skills in systems architecture and automation, always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow professionally.",
    "about-info-2": "I consider myself a self-taught person as I enjoy constantly learning every day, both new technologies and new software development practices, which help me polish and elevate my learning level.",
    "about-info-3": "I have experience working as a security analyst, which gave me the opportunity to work with and understand network architectures and devices (firewalls) alongside stages in software development. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to teach at the university level, which allowed me to share my knowledge with others and learn from them. I have evolved from an application manager and sysadmin for legacy applications to migrating to new container architectures, with Container Orchestration using tools like K8s and Docker. My current focus is on implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions and automating development and deployment processes, using tools like Terraform and Ansible.",
